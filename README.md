Digital System Design Lab 1 work

Devices and their test benches for Digital Systems Design Lab 2 Group 2 2016:

****************************************************************************************************************************************
To Done for prep:
-Code to be uploaded for each device: Component VHDL, TB VHDL file and UCF file where appropriate (assisgnmenst for UCF taken from Lab instructions).
-Truth Table for each device (to compare with timeing diagram)- for single bit input when busses are used
-Timeing diagrams screen shots of working diagrams (uploaded in word or publisher documents, cropped to appropriate size)
****************************************************************************************************************************************
