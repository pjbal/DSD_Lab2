# DSD_Lab2
Digital System Design Lab 1 work

Devices and their test benches for Digital Systems Design Lab 2 Group 2 2016:

To Done for prep:
-Code to be uploaded for each device: Component VHDL, TB VHDL file and UCF file.
-Truth Table for each device (to compare with timeing diagram)
-Systhesis and timeing diagrams screen shots of working diagrams.

Top Level devices:
1. 4-bit ALU (top-level device – code provided)
2. 4-bit Shifter (top-level device – code provided)
3. 4-bit LAC (look ahead carry) unit (code provided)
