# DSD_Lab2
Digital System Design Lab 1 work

Devices and their test benches for Digital Systems Design Lab 2 Group 2 2016:

To Done for prep:
-Code to be uploaded for each device: Component VHDL, TB VHDL file and UCF file.
-Truth Table for each device (to compare with timeing diagram)
-Systhesis and timeing diagrams screen shots of working diagrams.

Top Level devices:
1. 4-bit ALU (top-level device – code provided)
2. 4-bit Shifter (top-level device – code provided)
3. 4-bit LAC (look ahead carry) unit (code provided)
4. n-bit XOR control (example of a generic width device – code provided)

The devices we must prepare code for are:
1. 4-bit Arithmetic Unit
2. n-bit Logic Unit - hint: use a for-generate loop with generic bit-width
3. n-bit 2-input multiplexer (mux) - hint: use a for-generate loop with generic bit-width
4. 4-bit Adder/Subtractor
5. 4-bit LAC Adder
6. n-bit Adder
7. 1-bit logic function bit-slice (Logic Slice)
8. n-bit Shift/Rotate unit with left and right shift inputs
9. 4-input multiplexer
10. Shift control logic
